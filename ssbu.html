    <h2>Overview of SSBU</h2>
    <p>
      Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (SSBU) is a game developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2. SSBU belongs to a category of games called platform fighters, a kind of fighting game that emphasizes free 2D movement rather than in a restricted 3D space like most traditional fighting games. What makes Smash unique is its knockback mechanic.
      Instead of most fighting games that have health bars, characters instead have a percentage value shown at the bottom of the screen. As this percentage goes up, players take more knockback from other players' attacks, with the ultimate goal of the game being to knock the other players off of the main fighting area.
      The Smash series was the first to do this genre all the way back on the Nintendo 64 with the release of the original Super Smash Bros, and since then, every major Nintendo console has featured its own installment in the series. The most recent game in the series is SSBU, the game I play. Different Smash games feature different mechanics, different stages, and different characters to play as.
      The video shown below is the opening theme of the game Nintendo's tutorial shown on the title screen.

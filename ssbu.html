    <h2>Overview of SSBU</h2>
    <p>
      Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (SSBU) is a game developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2. SSBU belongs to a category of games called platform fighters, a kind of fighting game that emphasizes free 2D movement rather than in a restricted 3D space like most traditional fighting games. What makes Smash unique is its knockback mechanic.
      Instead of most fighting games that have health bars, characters instead have a percentage value shown at the bottom of the screen. As this percentage goes up, players take more knockback from other players' attacks, with the ultimate goal of the game being to knock the other players off of the main fighting area.
      The Smash series was the first to do this genre all the way back on the Nintendo 64 with the release of the original Super Smash Bros, and since then, every major Nintendo console has featured its own installment in the series. The most recent game in the series is SSBU, the game I play. Different Smash games feature different mechanics, different stages, and different characters to play as.
      The video shown below is the opening theme shown on launching the game.

    <h2>Competitive</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favorite things about SSBU is it's competitive scene. I've been involved for about a year now, and some of the most fun I've ever experience playing a video game. Not only do I enjoy it, but playing Smash competitively gives me goals to spend my time working towards. On top of that, I've made tons of friends and formed lasting relationships through the competitive scene.
      I also enjoy learning about the game itself, and almost every time I play, I learn something I didn't know before. And, while it's not quite feasible for me yet, it's possible to earn money competing in tournaments. I've yet to earn a single dollar playing the game, but it's something I enjoy doing and gives me something to do in my free time.
      Hopefully I can be among the world's best someday.
